1. Monthly average of 5 stock indexes (CSI 300, Finance, growth, cycle, consumption). Average the industrial added value of January and February each year, and then replace the original January and February values with the average. The data on investment growth, which is missing each year in January, is filled in with the data for February.
   
2.Calculate the correlation coefficient between the 5 stock index data and M2 data respectively. 

3. The 5 stock index data are respectively used as dependent variables, and the independent variables of CPI, M2, industrial added value and fixed asset investment growth rate are regression.
   
5. Mark all stages with CPI greater than 1.5 and M2 greater than 8, count the number of stages (the stage starts once the conditions are met, and the stage ends once the conditions are no longer met), then calculate the return rate of CSI 300 stock index in each stage, and then calculate the average return rate of stock index in all stages.
